We are thrilled to announce **Marco Roth** as a **speaker** at Rubycon 2026! Marco is a truly influential figure in the Ruby community, known for his significant contributions and unwavering dedication.

Marco is the maintainer of [**Herb**](https://github.com/marcoroth/herb) and [**ReactionView**](https://github.com/marcoroth/reactionview), projects that represent a historical moment for Rails Views and the semantic parsing of xERB templates. His work in this area has provided invaluable tools and insights for developers working with Ruby on Rails.

Beyond his technical contributions, Marco is also the visionary creator and ideator behind [**rubyevents.org**](https://www.rubyevents.org/). This fantastic platform serves as a central hub for Ruby events, allowing the community to stay informed about upcoming conferences, store valuable resources like videos, and connect with fellow Rubyists. It's a testament to his commitment to fostering a vibrant and connected Ruby ecosystem.

Marco is incredibly active in the community, frequently traveling and speaking at numerous conferences around the globe. He embodies the spirit of collaboration and knowledge sharing that makes the Ruby community so special. As we like to say, "he's one of us!"

We eagerly anticipate Marco's talk at Rubycon 2026 and are confident that his insights and experience will be a highlight of the conference. Stay tuned for more details on his session!
