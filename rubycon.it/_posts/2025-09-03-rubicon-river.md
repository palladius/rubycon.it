The Rubicon river had been for centuries the northern border between the area directly controlled by Rome and its allies and the Roman province of Cisalpine Gaul.

Crossing this border with an army was a deliberate act of insurrection against Rome and an automatic death sentence for the general and all his soldiers. Julius Caesar knew it very well, but he was aware that the Senate was plotting against him and eventually trying to murder him, and after a few days of hesitation, he decided to cross the river, occupy the city of Ariminum (modern #Rimini), and threaten to move his army to Rome.

It is believed that, while crossing the river, Caesar uttered the words "ἀνερρίφθω κύβος" (later translated in Latin as "Alea Iacta est", or "the die has been cast"), referring to the fact that his move would cause an inevitable course of events putting him and his soldiers in great danger.

In the end, he won the challenge and was later appointed as "Dictator" of the city of Rome.
