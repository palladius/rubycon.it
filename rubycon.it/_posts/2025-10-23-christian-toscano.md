Christian Toscano is a backend developer and (wannabe) tech writer who cut his teeth on Android development before discovering Ruby in 2021—a language that finally made coding feel like joy.

Now, he likes diving deep into Ruby on Rails, hunting for its quirks and crafting Ruby CLI tools just for fun.

When he’s not debugging or writing guides, he’s probably tinkering with DIY projects, working on side projects, or growing plants indoors, often mixing all three!
