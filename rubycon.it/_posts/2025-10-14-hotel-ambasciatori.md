Today we're thrilled to show you the amazing location we’ve secured for Rubycon 2026: the spectacular Hotel Ambasciatori in Rimini!

You know the conference agenda is going to be full of great Ruby content, but we chose May specifically so we can enjoy the absolute best of the Riviera: beautiful spring weather, no summer crowds, and total comfort.

The heated outdoor pool, the magnificent American Bar Terrace and the stunning conference room facing the sea are just a few of the many amenities we’ve prepared for you.

Get ready for an unbeatable conference experience!

See you in Rimini!
