Carmine Paolino’s journey with technology started early—at age 5, he wrote his first scripts to automate launching his favorite games. That moment of making a computer do exactly what he wanted felt like magic, and it sparked a lifelong fascination with technology.

These days, he is building AI tools he is passionate about: Chat with Work, which helps teams unlock the knowledge buried in their workplace documents. He also co-founded Freshflow, where they used AI to help supermarkets reduce food waste.

His path in technology has been driven by curiosity. From becoming Vice President and Technical Officer of the Italian Gentoo Linux community in his teens, to studying computer science at the University of Bologna where his work on large-scale social network analysis was published by Springer. This led him to AI at the Free University of Amsterdam, where he had the chance to work with an alumnus of Geoffrey Hinton on combining deep learning with his love for music.

Over the years, he has been fortunate to work with amazing teams at OLX, Capgemini, and the Alan Turing Institute, always learning new ways to solve real-world problems at scale. Each experience has taught him something valuable about building technology that matters.

When he is not coding or training models, he can be found making house and disco music as Crimson Lake, running Berlin’s Floppy Disco collective, or exploring the world through his camera lens.
