New day, new announcement! Today we are please to introduce you our next all star speaker: Julia López!

Julia López is from Barcelona and has been working with Rails for almost 15 years.

The last 10 years have been all about taking care of a senior Rails monolith, but her career is currently changing and while she is pursuing new challenges, her love for Rails, maintenance, upgrades, keeping applications healthy, and sharing practical knowledge still remains.

Her talks are always about things you can apply to your daily job as soon as you get back to it so expect to leave with actionable takeaways, not just inspiration!

We are looking forward to her talk at #Rubycon2026!
