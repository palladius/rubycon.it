Introducing Alessia Ragni!

Alessia is a Ruby developer who landed in the language by accident, her first company happened to use Ruby, and she immediately fell in love with its elegance and the fact that it lets you feel clever without actually being a genius.

Most of her experience comes from working in two companies on real production projects, across Ruby on Rails and Elixir. Ruby handled the design, Elixir handled the chaos. Both taught her a lot.

What truly won her over, though, was the Ruby community: friendly, supportive, and mostly ego-free, a rare thing in tech.
After attending events in Italy, Austria, and Bulgaria, she wanted to give something back to the community while cleverly staying out of the spotlight.

Beware if you are close to her, she loves food so much that you'll question every dietary choice you’ve ever made.
