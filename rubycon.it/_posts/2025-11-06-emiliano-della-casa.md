Emiliano is a software consultant based in Modena (Italy), working mainly on Ruby and related frameworks. 

His relationship with Ruby started in 2010, and it is by far the longest relation he has ever had: the love is still strong! More recently, Emiliano found out he enjoys talking about his missteps in Ruby, speaking at conferences like RubyDay 2024 in Verona, Euruko 2025 in Viana do Castelo, and DevFest Modena 2024 and 2025.

In his everyday life, Emiliano enjoys spending quality time with his beautiful family, playing  guitar, reading books, and cooking.

... and, yes, organizing Rubycon with a bunch of beautiful human beings!
