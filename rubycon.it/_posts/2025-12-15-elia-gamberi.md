Introducing Gamberi Elia,

Elia is a Consultant Developer based in Modena (Italy), with a special place in his heart for Ruby.

Searching for new opportunities while completing his studies (that he never finished), he discovered Ruby, in 2021, and thanks to Emiliano’s guidance, he fell in love with it immediately. Since then, he’s been chasing new challenges and sharing what he’s learned along the way. Recently, he co-founded Modena.rb, again with Emiliano, and has been talking about it wherever he goes.

If you cross paths with him, be ready: he’ll have plenty to say about code quality, TDD and obscure, never heard of, gems.
