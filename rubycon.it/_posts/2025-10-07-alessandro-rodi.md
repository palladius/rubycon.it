Alessandro Rodi has been a passionate Ruby on Rails Engineer since 2012. Ruby on Rails felt like a revelation and the key to escape, after being imprisoned in the Java ecosystem for six years.

After escaping the Java-verse, he moved to Switzerland, where he has been running a Ruby on Rails web agency called Renuo AG, in Zürich, since 2015.

Alessandro and his company are part of the Rails Foundation and, of course, of the broader Ruby community in general.

Alessandro also works on some Open Source gems, and all of them are extracted from the work done as a Web Agency.

Alessandro met Riccardo at the local ruby meetup in Zürich, and when he heard that a conference was being organized in his own region, he decided to help with the organization, hoping to show the rest of the Ruby community his territory.
