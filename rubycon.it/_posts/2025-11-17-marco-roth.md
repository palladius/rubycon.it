We are thrilled to announce that Marco Roth will be one of our speakers at Rubycon 2026.

Marco is a well-known figure in the Ruby community, and we are excited to have him on board.
He is the creator and maintainer of [Herb](https://github.com/trailblazer/herb), a new view framework for Ruby, and [ReactionView](https://github.com/marcoroth/reactionview), a semantic parsing of xERB templates.

He is also the creator of [rubyevents.org](https://www.rubyevents.org/), a great place to find Ruby events, and to be aware of what's coming, to store people, videos, and such.

Marco is very active in the community, travels and speaks to a lot of conferences. He's one of us.

We are looking forward to his talk at Rubycon 2026!
