Attending a Ruby conference in Italy means being exposed to great tech content, but also to amazing food!

Rimini, a vibrant city on the Adriatic coast, is not only famous for its beaches and history but also for a rich culinary tradition rooted in Emilia-Romagna and Romagna regional flavors.

The absolute king of Riminese street food is the *Piadina Romagnola*. This thin, unleavened flatbread, often confused with bread but distinct in its preparation with lard (or olive oil) and wheat flour, is a daily staple. It's traditionally folded and filled with squacquerone cheese, rocket, and prosciutto, or with various savory combinations like sausage and grilled vegetables. Every local has their favorite piadineria (piadina shop).

Next is the undisputed queen of first courses, the *Cappelletti in Brodo*. These small, ring-shaped pasta parcels are a testament to the region's dedication to fresh egg pasta. The filling is typically a delicate mix of soft cheese (like Raviggiolo or Formaggio di Fossa), nutmeg, and sometimes a hint of meat. While eaten throughout the year, they are the mandatory centerpiece of the Christmas and holiday table, served swimming in a rich, clear capon broth.

Finally, for the main course, there is the seafood specialty, *Brodetto di Pesce*. While many coastal towns in Italy have their own fish stew, Rimini's version is distinct, emphasizing the variety of fish caught right in the Adriatic Sea. The stew typically includes different types of local fish and shellfish, gently cooked in a tomato broth seasoned with vinegar, onions, and garlic. It is a hearty, flavorful dish that perfectly captures the taste of the sea.

We can't wait to take you to the best places to enjoy this incredible italian delicacies!
