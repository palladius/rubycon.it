### Why this program exists

We know that attending a conference isn’t always easy. Financial, personal, or structural barriers can make it hard to
take part. We want to bring together people from different backgrounds and experiences, by making our conference more
accessible.

### Apply for the Equity Tickets Program

You can apply for the Equity Tickets Program by [filling this
form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1sCt2fGW9bjVJVnskNn8NvTNNYQSazk7FQXAhULI1Vg0/edit).

#### Who can apply

You’re welcome to apply if you:

* Belong to an underrepresented group in tech, such as women, LGBTQIA+ people, people with disabilities, or people from
minority background.
* Face financial constraints, including students, unemployed people, early-career professionals, or anyone for whom the
ticket price would be a barrier.

You don’t need to fit every category, if this program feels relevant to you, we encourage you to apply.


#### What is included

Selected applicants will be contacted directly with instructions to claim their ticket and attend the conference at a
**symbolic cost of €20**.

Please note: **travel, accommodation, and food are not covered**.
