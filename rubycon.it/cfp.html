            <li><strong>Deadline:</strong> 15/01/2026</li>
            <li><strong>Content:</strong> a good mix of pure Ruby and Ruby on Rails content will be evaluated. We want to please a technical audience: the presentations will therefore be related to Ruby, Ruby gems, Ruby On Rails, or other topics close to the Ruby ecosystem. If you have non-technical topics, we regret that we cannot accept the proposal. If you have more generic topics, not strictly related to Ruby, we could still consider them.</li>
            <li><strong>Format:</strong> We will have eight 30-minute talks, with time for breaks and questions. This is a single-track conference.</li>
            <li class="mt-2"><strong>What to put in your submission:</strong></li>
            <li class="mt-2"><strong>Title:</strong> something short and engaging</li>
            <li><strong>Abstract:</strong> max 800 characters.</li>
            <li><strong>Talk type and structure:</strong> Expected Duration (eg 20-minute slides, 15-minute demo, ...)</li>
            <li><strong>Additional notes:</strong> Does it have a demo? Do you require internet?</li>
            <li><strong>Links to resources: </strong> existing slides, video/download previous talk, …</li>
            <li><strong>Short personal introduction: </strong>Tell us something about yourself.</li>
            <li class="mt-2"><strong>Travel requirements:</strong></li>
            <li class="mt-2">Can your company sponsor your travel/accommodation?</li>
            <li>If not, please let us know your needs. The conference hotel has rooms available for speakers, and we will strive to cover travel and accommodation expenses for each speaker as soon as we sell the first batch of tickets and secure our first sponsors.</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="mt-5">
        We will reach out closer to the date for travel and accommodation reimbursements.
        To ensure the high quality of the presentation, closer to the date, we will run a rehearsal of each session. This will allow us to guarantee the quality of talks for the conference and will give each speaker the possibility to receive feedback before the presentation. We owe this to our audience.
