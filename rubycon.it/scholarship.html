### Why this program exists

We know that attending a conference isn’t always easy. Financial, personal, or structural barriers can make it hard to
take part. We want to bring together people from different backgrounds and experiences, by making our conference more
accessible.

We are attentive to **equity** topics and we want to ensure everyone has a fair chance to participate.

You can apply for the Scholarship Program by [filling this
form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1sCt2fGW9bjVJVnskNn8NvTNNYQSazk7FQXAhULI1Vg0/edit).

### Who can apply

You’re welcome to apply if you:

* Belong to an **underrepresented group** in tech, such as women, LGBTQIA+ people, people with disabilities, or people
from
minority background.
* Face **financial constraints**, including students, unemployed people, early-career professionals, or anyone for whom
the
ticket price would be a barrier.

You don’t need to fit every category, if this program feels relevant to you, we encourage you to apply.

### What is included

Selected applicants will be contacted directly with instructions to claim their ticket and attend the conference at a
**symbolic cost of €20**. We believe that bringing this closer to zero would increase the risk of no-shows.

Please note: **travel, accommodation, and food are not covered**. But again, if you need more, lets us know in the form!

### Sponsors

The Equity Tickets Program is made possible thanks to our sponsors.

<!-- 
Tickets available:

* **2** (Typesense).
