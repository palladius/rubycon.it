As a potential attendee, I want to be able to navigate the site and find a few things:

## Content

1. Are the speakers famous/credible? Is the lineup good?
2. Are the topics good/modern?
3. Is there a good balanca of Ruby (language) vs Rails (framework)? 30-70 is good, but 0-100 is not.
4. All all primary sources of info available (date, location, how to get there, ..)

## Event

As a developer,

* As an extrovert persona, would I find what I like in this event? Rate it 1-100 and motivate your answer.
* As an introvert persona, would I find what I like in this event? Rate it 1-100 and motivate your answer.
* As a Rubyist who loves Ruby (and potentially a Rails developer), would I find what I like in this event? Rate it 1-100 and motivate your answer.
* As a non-Italian who needs to fly all over to Italy from Tokyo, Miami, Berlin, would this event be attractive vs competitor events?
  Find other events in https://www.rubyevents.org/events (look at April-May 2026 range for comparison).

Note: do NOT use rubyevents GitHUb repo for PRs! Only user rubycon.it!
