# CUJ 01: Potential Attendee Analysis
Executed on: 2026-01-16
Site Version: 0.4.29

## Content Analysis

### Speakers & Lineup
*   **Credibility:** The announced speakers (Carmine Paolino, Marco Roth, Julia López) are high-quality. They are maintainers of significant libraries (Ruby_LLM, Herb, ReActionView) or have long-standing experience (15y+ in Rails).
*   **Lineup:** Currently small (3 speakers), with many "TBD" slots. This might deter attendees looking for a full roster before committing, but the quality of the initial batch is a strong signal.

### Topics
*   **Modernity:** Topics cover AI/LLM integration with Ruby and modern frontend approaches (Hotwire/ViewComponent ecosystem via Herb/ReActionView). This is very current and appeals to developers looking to modernize their stack.

### Ruby vs Rails Balance
*   **Current Mix:**
    *   Carmine: Ruby + LLM (Ruby focus).
    *   Marco: Frontend + Rails (Rails focus).
    *   Julia: Rails (Rails focus).
*   **Assessment:** roughly 1:2 split. This fits the "30-70" good balance criteria perfectly. It's not just a Rails conference, nor just a Ruby language conference.

### Primary Info
*   **Date:** Clearly May 8, 2026.
*   **Location:** Hotel Ambasciatori, Rimini.
*   **Travel:** Basic info provided (train, car, airports). The logistics page is quite detailed with hotel options and airport advice.

## Persona Analysis

### Extrovert
**Score: 8/10**
*   **Why:** "Toga Party", "Networking" slots (welcome coffee, breaks, lunch) are explicitly scheduled. The single-track format encourages shared experiences and easier conversation starters.

### Introvert
**Score: 7/10**
*   **Why:** Single track avoids "fear of missing out" anxiety. Breaks are clearly defined. The Toga party might be overwhelming, but it's clearly labeled as a social event ("FUN"), allowing introverts to opt-out if needed. The venue being a hotel allows for easy "retreats" to the room.

### Rubyist
**Score: 9/10**
*   **Why:** The presence of "Ruby_LLM" and "Herb" suggests a deep dive into the language's capabilities and ecosystem, not just "how to build a CRUD app in Rails". This is highly attractive to language enthusiasts.

### Non-Italian / International Traveler
**Score: 7/10**
*   **Attractiveness:** Rimini is a prime destination (beach, history, food). The logistics page handles international airports (Bologna, Venice, etc.) well.
*   **Competition:** (Assuming checks on rubyevents.org) May is often busy for conferences. The unique selling point here is the "Italian seaside experience" + "Toga Party", which differentiates it from standard city conferences.
*   **Recommendation:** Ensure English is clearly stated as the primary language for all talks to reassure international attendees.

## Recommendations
1.  **Fill TBDs:** Prioritize filling the "TBD" slots in the schedule to show a full value proposition.
2.  **Explicit Language:** Explicitly state that talks are in English on the home/about page to attract the international audience.
3.  **Logistics:** The logistics page is good, but maybe add a map snippet or a visual guide for the walk from the station.
