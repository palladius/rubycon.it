# CUJ 05: Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Analysis
Executed on: 2026-01-16
Site Version: 0.4.40

## 1. Code of Conduct (CoC)
*   **Status:** 🔴 **CRITICAL MISSING**.
*   **Finding:** A search for "code of conduct" yielded zero results. A modern, inclusive conference **must** have a visible CoC to make diverse groups feel safe.
*   **Recommendation:** Adopt the [Berlin Code of Conduct](https://berlincodeofconduct.org/) immediately. Create `coc.md` and link it in the Footer and FAQ.

## 2. Inclusive Language
*   **Status:** 🟢 **PASS**.
*   **Finding:** No instances of "guys" or exclusionary language found in text content. The tone is generally welcoming.

## 3. Equity Page Analysis
*   **Status:** 🟡 **GOOD BUT CAN IMPROVE**.
*   **Tone:** Welcoming and non-patronizing. The explicit mention of "women, LGBTQIA+ people" sets a safe expectation.
*   **Cost Barrier:** The €20 symbolic fee is reasonable.
*   **Hidden Gem:** The sentence *"But again, if you need more, lets us know in the form!"* is excellent but buried.
*   **Student Perspective:** For a student with €0 budget, the travel/hotel is the blocker. The "let us know" clause is their only hope.
*   **Recommendation:** Make the "travel support" possibility more prominent, perhaps as a separate bullet point: "Need travel support? We might be able to help - ask in the form."

## 4. Visual Representation
*   **Status:** 🟢 **PASS**.
*   **Finding:** Speakers list includes diverse representation (Julia López, women in sponsors like SheTech). The "Toga party" might be culturally specific but seems fun rather than exclusionary.

## Summary
The site has a good "soul" regarding DEI (Equity page, diverse speakers), but the **missing Code of Conduct** is a major red flag that needs immediate fixing.
