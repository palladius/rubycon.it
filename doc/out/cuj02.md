# CUJ 02: Potential Sponsor Analysis
Executed on: 2026-01-16
Site Version: 0.4.29

## Documentation Analysis

### What's in it for me?
*   **Visibility:** The website prominently features sponsors in a dedicated section with logos and descriptions. The "Triumvir", "Praetor", and "Quaestor" tiers (Roman themed, nice touch) offer tiered visibility.
*   **Documentation:** There is **NO** dedicated "Sponsors" page or a downloadable "Prospectus" (PDF) visible on the site. The primary call to action is a simple `mailto:sponsors@rubycon.it` link.
*   **Missing Info:**
    *   Sponsorship tiers and prices.
    *   What exactly each tier includes (booth? logo size? talk slot? social media shoutouts?).
    *   Expected attendance numbers (crucial for ROI calculation).
    *   Demographics of attendees.

### Trustworthiness & Reputation

### Indicators of Trust
*   **Existing Sponsors:** The presence of reputable companies like **DatoCMS**, **AppSignal**, **TypeSense**, and **Avo** lends significant credibility. These are well-known in the Rails ecosystem.
*   **Community Support:** "Community" sponsors include major European conferences (RubyConf Austria, Helvetic Ruby, Wroclove.rb) and local groups (GrUSP, Modena.rb). This network of support strongly suggests the organizers are well-connected and trusted by their peers.
*   **Organizers:** The "About" section (implied, though not fully analyzed here, but "Ruby at the core" and community connection mentioned) and the speaker lineup (Carmine, Marco) show real people with real reputations in the community.
*   **Event Scale:** It feels like a boutique/community event rather than a massive corporate expo. "Serious but cozy" vibe.

### Return on Investment (ROI) Potential
*   **Publicity:** Good for brand awareness within the niche Ruby/Rails community in Europe (and specifically Italy).
*   **Reputation Risk:** Low. The event aligns with standard community values (inclusivity, open source). The "family-friendly" and "inclusive" messaging (found in other parts of the site) mitigates risk of "nasty" associations.

## Recommendations for Improvement

1.  **Create a Sponsorship Prospectus:** Create a dedicated page (`/sponsors/`) or a PDF document outlining:
    *   **Tiers & Pricing:** Transparency helps sponsors decide quickly.
    *   **Stats:** Expected attendee count (even a conservative estimate).
    *   **Benefits:** Explicitly list what they get (e.g., "Logo on t-shirt", "2 free tickets", "Booth space").
2.  **Highlight "Why Sponsor":** Add a section explicitly addressing sponsors, perhaps with testimonials from current sponsors or organizers of partner conferences.
3.  **Social Proof:** You already have great logos. Maybe add a quote from one of the "Triumvir" sponsors about why they chose to support RubyCon.it.
