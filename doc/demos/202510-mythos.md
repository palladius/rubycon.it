## Table of Committers

```markdown

Look at the last 30 commits. Show me a table of all committers, 1 committer per row with N commits each.

---

Now try to look at a few git diffs per person, to tell me what these people are usually contributing to - is there a pattern? Add it as 3rd column.

Who committed the logo @rubycon.it/assets/images/logo.png ?

Explain to audience:

* The first table was deterministic, we can ask Gemini CLI to write a `git-committers-table.sh`.
* The second had a non-deterministic side, and Gemini CLI is great at "vibe answering" it mixing determinism and not. This is where it shines. Can be done in 20seconds.
  * This could be also coded by Gemini CLI, probably writing some ADK code which does this:
  * Can be done in probably a few hours of work (needs to be tested, won't work at first time).
    *  `adk-git-committers-with-style.py`. Use **context7** for Gemini to know how to code ADK.
    *  Probably *Firebase Studio* would do a better job here.
