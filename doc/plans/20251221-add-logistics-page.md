# Plan to add a Logistics page

Here is the plan to add the new `/logistics` page to the website.

1.  **Create the data file**: Create a new file `rubycon.it/_data/logistics.yml` to store logistics information like nearby hotels and travel details.
2.  **Create the include file**: Create a new file `rubycon.it/_includes/logistics.html` which will be used to render the content of the logistics page.
3.  **Create the page file**: Create the main page file `rubycon.it/logistics.md` that defines the URL and uses the include file.
4.  **Update navigation**: Add a link to the new Logistics page in the main navigation menu by editing `rubycon.it/_data/navigation.yml`.
5.  **Review**: Ask user to review the new page.
