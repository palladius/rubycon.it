# Plan to add Hotel Ambasciatori to nearby_hotels

## Subtasks:

1.  **Create a new entry for Hotel Ambasciatori in `rubycon.it/_data/logistics.yml` under the `nearby_hotels` section.**
    *   This entry will include `name`, `stars`, and `ballpark_price_eur`.
    *   It will also include a placeholder for `url`, `walking_distance`, and `notes` to be filled in later if needed, or to explicitly state it's the same as the venue hotel.
2.  **Update `rubycon.it/_config.yml` version.**
3.  **Update `CHANGELOG.md` with the change.**
