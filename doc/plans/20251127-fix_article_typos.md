# Plan: Fix Typos in Articles

I have scanned the articles in `rubycon.it/_posts` and found a few minor typos and inconsistencies.

## 1. Fix Capitalization of "Ruby"
- **File:** `rubycon.it/_posts/2025-09-09-riccardo-carlesso.md`
  - Change: "ruby came preinstalled" -> "Ruby came preinstalled"
- **File:** `rubycon.it/_posts/2025-10-07-alessandro-rodi.md`
  - Change: "local ruby meetup" -> "local Ruby meetup"

## 2. Fix Inconsistent Naming
- **File:** `rubycon.it/_posts/2025-09-10-why-are-we-doing-this.md`
  - Change: "Rubyday 2024" -> "RubyDay 2024" (to be consistent with other mentions)
- **File:** `rubycon.it/_posts/2025-10-28-carmine-paolino-speaker.md`
  - Change: "RubyCon Italy" -> "Rubycon Italy" (to be consistent with other mentions)

## 3. Fix Spacing
- **File:** `rubycon.it/_posts/2025-11-06-emiliano-della-casa.md`
  - Change: "playing  guitar" -> "playing guitar" (remove double space)

## Verification
- I will verify the changes by reading the files again or using `grep` to ensure the typos are gone.
