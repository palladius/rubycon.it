# Plan to improve the Logistics page

Here is the plan to improve the `/logistics` page.

1.  **Restructure the HTML**: The `rubycon.it/_includes/logistics.html` will be updated to use a card-based layout. I'll use a grid to display the main sections: Venue, Hotels, and Travel.
2.  **Add Visual Elements**: I will add emojis to the section titles (Venue 🏨, Hotels 🏨🏨🏨, Travel ✈️🚆🚗) to make them more engaging.
3.  **Enhance Readability**: I will use icons and better spacing within the cards to make the information easier to digest. Each travel option (Air, Train, Car) will have its own icon.
4.  **Review**: Ask user to review the improved page.
